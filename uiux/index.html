            This documentary captures my journey through the world of film photography in the digital age. Wandering the streets of New York, I frame fleeting moments through an analog lens. In the darkroom, silence and shadows give life to each image, a contrast to the instant gratification of digital screens. Conversations with fellow film enthusiasts reveal a shared devotion to the tactile, deliberate process of creation. From Miami’s sunlit shores to the depths of the Caspian Sea, I explore the textures and timeless beauty that only film can preserve. The film ends in quiet stillness—a reminder of the slowness and depth that analog photography offers in a restless world.
